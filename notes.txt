"In Regolith, the i3 config file is at /etc/regolith/i3/config and users can supply their own copy that will override this default if placed at ~/.config/regolith/i3/config."

- place system-wide scripts in /usr/local/bin or /sbin then make them executable with sudo chmod +x [script]

- set a startup script for i3 with exec startup

example: exec chromium
exec_always ~/my_script.sh
